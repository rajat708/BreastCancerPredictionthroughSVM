# BreastCancerPredictionthroughSVM
In all the previous Support Vector Machine implementations, points which lie very close to the dividing hyperplane are not taken care of and are usually ignored. If we run the prediction function, there are high chances that these points can randomly lie either side of the hyperplane and affect the accuracy of the algorithm due to misclassification of instances. Here we propose a new classification algorithm (SVM-KNN Hybrid) which uses the combination of the features of Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor to reduce this misclassification.
